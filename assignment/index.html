    <h1>Week 4 Assignment - Part 3</h1>
    <p>See console for output.</p>
    <!-- Create an unordered list with any questions you have -->
    <ul>
      <li>How do I format a return statement so it shows that I've added and item, therefore its 'true'?</li>
      <li>Did I do the addItem correctly? In the console my array is shown, but I don't know if that is actually doing what I'm asked.</li>
      <li>I thought a for loop would list each item of 'basket' variable on its own line, but I either got undefined, or nothing. Where do I find how to make this work?</li>
    </ul>
